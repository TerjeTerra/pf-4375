The project simulates handling the electoral process by fetching and manipulating data in JSON format. The application showcases the following features:

- **Interactive Party Cards**: Implementation of clickable UI elements for each political party, designed to encapsulate key information and enhance user interaction.
- **Detail Presentation**: Detailed presentation of each party is available in a dedicated view, offering users a comprehensive look at party-specific information.
- **Data Collection & Processing**: The app is equipped to collect and organize voting data from various districts, showcasing the capacity to handle complex data structures.
- **Modern Android Development**: The project leverages Jetpack Compose for UI development and adheres to Kotlin's idiomatic coding practices for a modern and streamlined codebase.

## Implementation

The core functionality of the project involves the following components:

- **Clickable Cards**: Each party is represented by a card that, when tapped, will navigate the user to a view with more elaborate details about the party.
- **Party Details**: A new view is generated to display comprehensive details about the selected party, enhancing user engagement.
